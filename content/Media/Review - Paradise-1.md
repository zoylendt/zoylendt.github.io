One thing in advance: **Paradise-1** is the first book of a series called "Red Space", wich will include at least another volume. Since this fact is nowhere stated on the (german) cover, I was very surprised by the cliffhanger end which occurs perceived minutes before the story's culmination point. 
As many storylines already feel completed, I assume that a bunch of new characters has to be introduced in the next volume.
