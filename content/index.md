Hi, welcome to my blog ;)


Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [[showcase|already using Quartz]] to publish personal notes, websites, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.

## 🪴 Get Started :D 5

Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14** and `npm` v9.3.1 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once you've done so, see how to:

1. [[authoring content|Writing content]] in Quartz
2. [[configuration|Configure]] Quartz's behaviour
3. Change Quartz's [[layout]]
4. [[build|Build and preview]] Quartz
5. [[hosting|Host]] Quartz online

6. [[markdown guide|top level]]
7. [[Markdown/markdown guide|lower level]]
