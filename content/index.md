Hi, welcome to my notes and thoughts :D

This blog runs on a [[Quartz Personalization|slightly modified]] version of the static-site generator [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and backed up with Obsidian's git plugin. [[This website|Here]] I've documented my workflow.

Soon after realizing that my previous method, (digital) "Zettelwirtschaft", an unsustainable way of organizing my thoughts was, was I searching for an alternative, something with more structure. I chose Quartz for its [native integration](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/Obsidian-compatibility) with Obsidian and its other great [features](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-features), like the incredible fast [search](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/full-text-search) (try `[ctrl]+[k]`), the [popover previews](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/popover-previews) (hover over an [[Booklist|internal link]]) and the [graph view](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/graph-view) (klick the little graph symbol in the Graph View's top right corner). These features make Quartz an ideal choice as a [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) system, a [second brain](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/second-brain) or a ["digital garden"](https://mwalton.me/thoughts/digital-forests), a topic which I haven't explored myself yet.

By making my notes public I'm forcing myself to write with some coherence in mind, which should help me finding notes if I search for them. Hopefully it will also improve my english writing skills (most of this blog is in english, but some notes, mainly [[tags/recipe|recipes]], are in [[tags/german|german]]). As a final inspiration, I've come quite often across some tech blogs on the web after googling about how to implement something or resolve a specific, often [[Selfhosted/]] related problem, so I hope this pile of notes may be useful to somebody else someday :D

## My interests

I aim to write about many different topics, but they can (hopefully) be categorized in some way. There are also overviews of all üìÑ [[tags/note|notes]] and all üè∑[[tags]].

- üß† [[Braindump]]  
A place for thoughts and stuff that doesn't fit the other categories. New ideas, unfinished thoughts, plans, things I stumbled upon the net, stuff like that ;)
   - [[tags/todo|ToDo]] 
   - [[tags/unfinished|unfinished blog entries]] 
- üç∫ [[Brewing|Home Brewing and cooking Recipes]]  
A hobby of mine is home brewing which I like for its combination of traditional techniques, modern experiments, its fusion of handcrafting and automation - and of course it provides you with tasty beer ;)  
Documenting my suds (brewing processes, "Sud" in german) was a big motivation for creating this blog, besides my [[Selfhosted/]] hobby.  
In this category I also deal with other food-related topics, like brewing mead, fermenting kombucha, baking bread and general cooking recipes.
   - [[tags/beer|Beer]]
   - [[tags/bread|Bread]]
   - [[tags/fermenting|Fermenting]]
   - [[tags/recipe|General cooking recipes]]
- üìë [[Coding|Coding, Programming & Note Taking]]  
Here I write about my Obsidian setup and how I use it to deploy this website on GitHub, 
   - üìÑ [[Markdown guide|Markdown Guide]]
