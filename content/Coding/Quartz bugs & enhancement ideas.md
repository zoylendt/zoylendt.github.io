  - enhancement ideas and bugs 
	  - add `-`, `->` or `/cdot` in front of chapters in ToC, in order to enhance readability
		  - (or some default emoji, if none is present already)
		  - `->` renders in ToC as `<span>&rarr;</span>`
	  - searching for `foo.bar` returns sites containing `foo` and `bar` separately as well
	  - specify a part of .md file that doesn't get parsed into quartz (e.g. for `dataview`, like [here](https://obsidian.rocks/dataview-in-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/#List_unlinked_files))
	  - check for dead (internal) links
	  - if the string `#foo` appears in a .md file outside of the frontmatter, it gets added to the list of tags despite not being present in the frontmatter
