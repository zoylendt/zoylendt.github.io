First check if no file (outside of `/content`) that you have modified has been updated. For this the earlier created branch `upstream` comes in handy, it is a "snapshot" of the upstream repo at the moment you forked (or last synced) it. Compare changes here: https://github.com/zoylendt/zoylendt.github.io/compare/upstream...jackyzha0%3Aquartz%3Av4 (for my repo).

Sync both branches (`upstream` and `v4`) with https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz by clicking `Sync fork -> Update branch`:
