# All I have written about Quartz

This page is intended to be a starting point, if you want to know how to build your own Quartz blog, either with a quick basic setup or with many individualizations to customize the appearance. All my code changes for this blog have I documented [[My quartz config files|here]]. Another note is about [[Quartz sync fork|how to keep your installation up to date with the upstream repository]], if you want to include patches and new features. 

I've also documented my workflow for new blog entries, using Obsidian and its git plugin (among other plugins I use). My folder structure in Obsidian has also relevance for this. You can also read about [[Obsidian on multiple PCs|how to use Obsidian on multiple PCs simultaneously]].
