# All I have written about Quartz

This page is intended to be a starting point if you want to know how to build your own Quartz blog, either with a [[Quartz basic setup|quick basic setup]] or with many individualizations to customize the appearance. All my code changes for this blog have I documented [[My quartz config files|here]]. Another note is about [[Quartz sync fork|how to keep your installation up to date with the upstream repository]], if you want to include patches and new features. While tinkering with my Quartz setup I noticed some minor [[Quartz bugs & enhancement ideas|bugs and came up with some improvement ideas]] aswell.

I've also documented my [[My obsidian git quartz workflow|workflow for new blog entries]], using Obsidian and its git plugin (among [[Obsidian Plugins|other plugins I use]]). My [[My obsidian folder structure|folder structure in Obsidian]] has also relevance for this. You can also read about [[Obsidian on multiple PCs|how to use Obsidian on multiple PCs simultaneously]].
